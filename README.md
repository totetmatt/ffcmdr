# FFcmdr

Helper library to build an manipulate FFmpeg command line.

Huge inspiration from Keras model builder and Airflow DAG.

Not exactly a wrapper, but if gives tools to build your own based on your requierments.

## Idea in mind
* Separation between the filter_complex module and the command build module
* Trying to be as close as possible to the generated command line
* Making "Blueprint-able" ready
* Minimal Dependency
